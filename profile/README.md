Welcome to the open-source GitHub organization hosted by The Way Lab.

We are a team of scientists and engineers developing methods and software for analyzing microscopy images of cells.
Our mission is to reduce human suffering.

## Projects

We are leading multidisciplinary scientists in a variety of team-science initiatives.

### Pediatric Cancer Cell Morphology Atlas

We are developing a reference Cell Painting data set of pediatric cancer cell lines, and performing several high-throughput, high-content phenotypic drug screens.

### 3D profiling of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 patient-derived organoids

We are developing a 3D image analysis pipeline to profile patient-derived organoids from neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients, and we will be performing several  high-throughput, high-content phenotypic drug screens.

### Finding new therapeutics for cardiac fibrosis

We are identifying fundamental differences between cardiac fibroblasts from patients with and without heart failure, and we are developing a high-throughput, high-content phenotypic drug screen to identify new therapeutics for cardiac fibrosis.
